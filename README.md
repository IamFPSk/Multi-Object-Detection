# Multi-Object Detection

This project showcases the implementation of a state-of-the-art object detection model to identify and localize objects within images. Leveraging the Faster R-CNN architecture and pre-trained weights, this project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to perform accurate and efficient object detection tasks.

## Key Features

- Integration of the Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50 backbone, pre-trained on the COCO dataset, for object detection.
- Processing input images using OpenCV and PIL libraries to prepare them for inference by the object detection model.
- Predicting bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores for detected objects within the input images using the Faster R-CNN model.
- Providing visual representations of the detected objects by overlaying bounding boxes and class labels on the input images using OpenCV's drawing functions.

## Applications

- Visual Surveillance
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Retail Analytics
- Industrial Automation
