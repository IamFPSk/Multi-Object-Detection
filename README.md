Project Overview: 

The Object Detection with Faster R-CNN project showcases the implementation of a state-of-the-art object detection model to identify and localize objects within images. Leveraging the Faster R-CNN architecture and pre-trained weights, this project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to perform accurate and efficient object detection tasks. Key Features: he project integrates the Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50 backbone, pretrained on the COCO dataset, for object detection. It processes input images using OpenCV and PIL libraries to prepare them for inference by the object detection model. Utilizing the Faster R-CNN model, it predicts bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores for detected objects within the input images. To provide visual representations of the detected objects, the project overlays bounding boxes and class labels on the input images using OpenCV's drawing functions. Applications: Visual Surveillance, Autonomous Vehicles, Retail Analytics, Industrial Automation, etc.
